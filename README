Dockbar Experimental 0.21.9

Description:
This is DockBar (a TaskBar with grouping and group manipulation) with some "experimental" features. 

This is not really a fork of DockBar! It's just an experimental version. Some of the features in this version will hopefully find it's way into the vanilla DockBar some day, when they are proven stable and useful.

Experimental features (Features that isn't in vanilla DockBar 0.21):
- New popup look
- Launchers
- Notifications for focused window on group button as well as on window button
- Minimize animation is aiming for the group button of the program.
- All mouse button actions are configurable
- Behavior when multiple workspaces or viewports are used are configurable
- Windows are raised on drag-and-drops
- "Opacify"

Stability:
This is an experimental version. In one sense that means less stability. I will try to keep this program stable in the sense "as few bugs as possible", of course. It won't be stable in the sense that the programs default behavior will stay the same from a version to the next.


=======
INSTALL
=======
- install python-gnome2-desktop and python-numpy (Dockbar Experimental might be able to run without python-numpy, but it shouldn't hurt)
- copy dockbarx.py to /usr/bin/ and GNOME_DockBarXApplet.server to /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
- copy the themes folder to /usr/share/dockbar (for system wide installation, recommended) or ~/.dockbar (Create the folders if necessary)
- add DockBar applet (Experimental Version) to panel

You can run it in window (meant for debugging purposes, mostly):
dockbarx.py run-in-window

INSTALL IN AWN

1. Do a normal install (no need to add dockbarx to panel if you don't want to, of course).
2. Copy everything from the AWN folder to ~/.config/awn/applets
3. Remove original taskbar/launcher applet from awn (optional, but recommended)
4. Set 'Icon offset' parameter to 0!
5. Restart AWN
6. Add DockBar applet


=====
USAGE
=====

*NOTE!* 
Default buttons are NOT the same as in vanilla Dockbar. All buttons are configurable in preference dialog.

Window button:
left click:
- activate / minimize / unminimize

middle click:
- close window

right click:
- minimize and lock

Group button:
left click:
- activate / minimize / unminimize group (launch application if no window is open)

shift + left click:
- launch application

middle double click:
- close group of windows

right click:
-open 'menu'


Add launchers:
To add launchers simply drag the launcher you want from your gnome menu to the DockBar. (That means that you should drop it ON an existing button, not to the right or left of them. If you drop the launcher to the right of the buttons you will drop it on the panel and not on the DockBar applet). Write in the resource class name of the application whose launcher you added in the entry dialog and press OK (if the program is already running you can choose the resource class name from the drop down list). The launcher will appear after (on the right side) of the button you dropped the launcher of.

Remove launcher:
Right click on the launcher you wish to remove. Choose 'Remove launcher' from the menu. This will also close all open windows of that group button.

Move launchers (and other group buttons):
Drag and drop ;)


Workspace/viewport behavior:
You can change how DockBar reacts when you select a group (left click on the group icon if the default is used) from preference window.

Ignore: Acts as if windows on other workspaces and viewport doesn't exist.

Switch: Behaves as ignore if there are windows belonging to the group on the current workspace/viewport. If there are no windows belonging to the group on the current workspace/viewport it switches to the workspace/viewport with most windows that belong to the group. This is the default behavior.

Move: Moves windows from other workspaces/viewports to current workspace/viewport. This is the behavior vanilla Dockbar 0.20 uses.

If you select a window in the popup list you will always switch to the workspace/viewport of the window. This is not configurable (vanilla Dockbar behaves the same way).

FAQ
===
Q: Help!?! I want to add an launcher but I don't know the resource class name of the program.
A1: The easiest way to add a launcher is to start the program first and then drag the launcher to to the DockBar. The resource class name can then be found in the drop down list.
A2: You can also find the resolution class name by: 1) launching the program your usual way, 2) when the icon appears in DockBar, hower over it and 3) when the popup window is shown, hower over the popup window title. The resource class name will be shown as a tooltip.


Q: I don't like the looks of launcher buttons. How can I change it?
A: You can change the looks of the launcher button by editing ~/.dockbar/launcher_icon.png (if you have no ~/.dockbar/launcher_icon.png, copy it from /usr/share/pixmaps/dockbar/launcher_icon.png). You can change it however you want as long as it is a png-file. 

If you have an artistic personality and make a beautiful launcher_icon.png, don't hesitate to send it to me. I hope I will be able to publish a package of alternative launcher icons soon.
