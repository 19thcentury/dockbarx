Experimental 0.21.10
- Dockbarx now uses themes. They are .tar.gz files that should be put in /usr/share/dockbar/themes or ~/.dockbar/themes. Documentation on how to make themes will come later but you could always take a look on the existing theme files and try to change them, if you are curious. Be aware the much will still change when it comes to the format of the config file in the theme, though. New themes are added simply by moving them to either folder. 
- There are no more delays before closing the popup window when the mouse cursor is moved away from the group button (this should make those of you who uses no popup delay happy). On the other hand, when the mouse cursor is resting in the gap between group button and windowpane the window won't close (this should make slow moving people happy). This will hopefully lead to fewer situations where the popup window is left open as well.

Experimental 0.21.9
- A popup menu is added as a window button action (At right click in default settings).
- (Un)maximize all windows and (un)minimize all windows options are added to the group button popup menu.
- Brightness effect on launcher buttons are now only affecting the icon, not the whole button.
- New group button action Maximize all and new windows button action toggle maximized are added.
- Group button actions Select and Select or minimize no longer unlocks all locked windows in the group.
- Bug #374850 fixed: A small bug in the icon selection algorithm that caused dockbarx to crash in some situations. (Fix by Vermind, thx.)

Experimental 0.21.8
- Drag and drop of new launchers and moving of group buttons shows an indicator of where the group button will be placed.
- Onnmouseover brightness effect added. (This is just a temporary test and I will remove it unless I get positive feedback on it. Tell me your opinion!)
- Bug #371119 fixed: Pidgin contact list couldn't be activated, minimized or unminimized using select [or minimize] window button action.
- Bug #372235 possibly fixed: Opacify might work now with Compiz Fusion 0.7.4 (used in Ubuntu Hardy). (Compiz Fusion 0.7.4 users please tell me if this is true!)

Experimental 0.21.7
- When unlocking a window using lock/unlock action, the window is no longer unminimized.
- Move cursor is shown instead of copy cursor when moving a group button.
- Active window is set at startup.
- Bugfix: DockBarx didn't start if added to a vertical panel.
- Bug #370104 fixed: Preference dialog now works in hardy and other systems that uses pygtk <2.14.
- Bug #368721 fixed: Compiz scale all action doesn't leave popup window open anymore.
- Code clean up and documentation

Experimental 0.21.6
- It's now possible to raise windows via popup window during drag and drops. (Similar to what you can do with gnome's normal window list.)
- Delay added to opacify
- When using opacify, clicking a window button now brings transparency back to normal.
- Opacify is not initiated for minimized windows anymore.
- New window button action: Select window (no minimize).
- New group button action: Compiz scale all.

Experimental 0.21.5-1
- Really stupid bug fixed. Big "Sorry!" for not checking the code before releasing it.

Experimental 0.21.5
- Opacify: When the mouse cursor is over a window name in popup window all other windows get transparent. Activate it from preference dialog. (You need to activate "Opacity, Brightness and Saturation" plugin in compiz to use it.)
- AWN wrapper ported from vanilla DockBar (by Scott Barnes).

Experimental 0.21.4
- Bug fix: Popup windows didn't always resize correctly under Compiz if dockbarx were killed and restarted.
- The title of popup windows uses the normal text color instead of always being white.
- Small fixes to Compiz scale and compiz switch actions.
- Typo fixed.

Experimental 0.21.3
- Options in preference dialog for changing colors and transparency.
- Preference dialog is now split in two tabs (behavior and appearance).
- Bug fixes (unconfirmed).

Experimental 0.21.2
- New group button action: Compiz switch. Needs to be selected in preference dialog to be used (I recommend setting it on scroll up or down). Compiz switch plug in needs to be activated as well.
- When a group holds the active window and (a) minimized window(s) only the "normal" half will glow. (Once again: I'm really not sure if this looks any better. Opinions needed.)
- Some bug fixes. Tell me if any bug you reported has disappeared.

Experimental 0.21.1-1
- Bugfix: stupid bug stopping dockbarx from running in window.
- Slightly less transparency on active glow

Experimental 0.21.1
- The icons are now 2 pixels shorter on height and width. This will ensure a pixel on every side of the icon reserved for the active glow.
- The active glow is now changed to utilize it's extra space (meaning the glow is no longer overlapping the icon near the borders).
- The glow is now thicker and is fading towards it's ends.
- Some code clean up.

Experimental 0.21.0
- Version number changed to follow vanilla Dockbar (nothing ported over from vanilla Dockbar since 0.21 was a bugfix release for bugs - unless I'm mistaken - shouldn't exist in DockbarX)
- Minimized group icons are less transparent and has a slight notion of color in them
- The transition between the "minimized" and the "normal" half of the group button when some windows in a group are minimized is now smoother.
- The group button holding the active button "glows" now instead of using active_icon.png. (Tell me if the glow is a good idea or not. If it is I will add options for changing it's color and thickness from the preference dialog, othervice I will remove it and go back to using active_icon.)

Experimental 0.20.8
- Resource class name is used instead of class name to keep groups together. Before this change DockBarX couldn't recognize that windows of some applications (like video window and control window for xine-ui) belonged together. Some applications (vlc amongst others) don't have a resource class name. These applications will still be using their class name.
- DockBarX tries to find the correct name for the application to show in the popup instead of just showing the class name. The algorithm is far from perfect. Please report any really odd names!
- If you need to know the resolution class name for adding a launcher, it's added as a tooltip to the title of the popup window.
- Another stupid bug fixed. (Hopefully this bug fix will stop jaunty from giving false crash reports for DockBarX.)

Experimental 0.20.7
- A completely redesigned popup look (with transparency if compositing is used)
- The light-up effect is removed from launcher rollover and the name of the application is shown instead. (Feedback needed: is this an improvement or not?)

Experimental 0.20.6
- Bug fix: Some programs (wine and possibly others) didn't show up in DockBar.
- Bug fix: Popup list blocks the popup menu. (This was actually already fixed in a silent update of 0.20.5, I apologize for not announcing it.)

Experimental 0.20.5
- New more intuitive look on minimized and locked window buttons

Experimental 0.20.4
- Adjustable popup delay (default 250 ms)
- As requested: Popup window alignment can be set in the preference dialog (Center alignment default)
- Dockbar now uses other gconf values than just strings (doesn't matter to you End-Users, unless you want to change settings with gconf-editor instead of preference dialog) 

Experimental 0.20.3
- Bug fix: DockBar won't crash if it can't find launcher_icon.png or active_icon.png
- Minor bug fixed: The popup list is closed when the viewport changes because of select group or select window actions. This way there are no risk that the popup is left open even if the mouse moved away from the group button during the switch animation.

Experimental 0.20.2
- The stupid bug fixed

Experimental 0.20
- The name is changed to DockBar Experimental or dockbarx for short to make it possible to have both vanilla DockBar
  and Dockbar Experimental installed at the same time.

   - Preference and about dialog, gconf configuration
   - Configurable "needs attention" effect
