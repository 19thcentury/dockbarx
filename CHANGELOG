Changelog:

x.0.39
DockbarX x.0.39 uses re-arranged code. DockbarX is now an python package. This will probably make future versions of DockbarX more stable and speed up the development some.

Installation:
- DockbarX is now installed from a setup.py. To install dockbarx simply run "sudo setup.py install".

End user features:
- DockbarX do now show recent and most used files in the menu when right clicking a group button. This feature requires zeitgeist and only works for programs with zeitgeist data sources.
- Drop a file on a group button and DockbarX will try to launch that application with that file.
- DockbarX can be used as an AWN 0.4 applet again.
- DockbarX preference can now be reached from gnome-menu (and consequently be pinned). This is useful for AWN users since you can't reach dockbarx by right clicking the handle when DockbarX is used as an AWN applet.
- BigRZA was kind enough to design an icon for dockbarx.

Bug fixes:
- Bug #576671 (and duplicates): DockbarX preference window didn't open.
- Bug #580374 (and duplicates): Missing .desktop files for a dockbarx launcher won't result in a crash anymore.
- Various bugs regarding Opacify is fixed.
- Some other small bugs fixed as well.


x.0.30
End user features:
- Previews added! This feature is still in beta state, though. (Enable it from advanced tab in preference dialog)
- Improved looks for the window list.
- Dockbarx has the option to show icons for windows on the current workspace only now. (See advanced tab)
- Wine applications are no longer all grouped together (unless you want them to be, see advanced tab).
- OpenOffice applications can be separated so that you have different group buttons for the applications (writer, calc, etc.). This also makes openoffice use themed icons and as well as being pin-able. (See advanced tab)
- Drag and drop is improved: If you drag anything to an group button with just one open window, the window will be brought up automatically without the need to go to the popup list first. Also, the drop indicator for launchers is made less clumsy and the new look of the popup window make drag and drop through them easier.
- The windows 7 like option "Show popup" for selecting multiple windows is added (see group button tab in preference dialog).  By Robin Burchell.
- Preference dialog is now separated from rest of dockbarx. It can be started either the old way or with the command "dbx_preference.py"

Theme makers:
- The theme eninge uses cairo in stead of pixbufs now. The biggest change (read: inconvenience) is that alpha_mask now uses the actual alpha channel instead of the color channels. The themes need to be updated to work correctly. The resize algorithm is new as well, so check if your themes looks like they used to. Sorry for the inconveniences.
- A size attribute is added to the if command. It uses the same syntax as the windows_cnt attribute. See theming howto for more information.

Bug fixes:
- Bug #507692: Dockbarx background wasn't tranparent.
- Bug #510619: Clicking at pixels around the borders of dockbarx should now work.
- Dockbarx works ok in vertical mode again.



x.0.24.1-1
DockbarX is compatible with python 2.5 (Ubuntu 8.10) again.

x.0.24.1
End user features:
- An effect on application launch is added (only if the theme supports it). It's static and will be shown from the time a dockbarx launcher is clicked until the window is shown (or in ten seconds max).
- The custom colors are now saved separately for every theme. When you load a new theme for the first time the default colors for the theme will be loaded. If change any color it will only effect that theme. When you change back to the theme you used before the colors will change back as well.
- More color options (see theme making features and theming howto for more info.)
- The theme drop down in preference dialog shows the themes in alphabetical order.
- Default theme is updated to support the launching effect and the new color options. New theme got that as well and some more. ;)
- Theme Gaia (know as Gaia 09 by Izoblalax) is added and updated to support all the new dockbarx features.

Theme making features:
- Themable launching effect added. The command is <if type="launching">.
- New custom color system. The themes can now set default colors, opacity values and the color name that will be shown in preference dialog.
- There are now eight custom colors. The functions of color1 to color4 (popup window color and text colors) are hardcoded since the popup window isn't theme-able. Color5 is the color previously known as "attention glow". Color6 to color8 set to "not used" if the theme maker doesn't give them a name. 
See theming HOWTO for more details.

Bug fixes:
- In some case dockbarx didn't start if launchers for some programs were added.
- Dockbarx didn't save the changes if the resource class of a launcher were change manually.
- Some programs like the terminal started in root folder "/" instead of in of the users home folder "~/" (Bug #500171)
- Some windows didn't turn up in dockbarx (Bug 501820)

x.0.24.0
A new launcher system (inspried by Aleksey's elegant launcher system from vanilla dockbar):
- When you add a launcher by dragging a application from gnome menu you no longer have to enter a resource class name, dockbarx guesses it.
- If dockbarx isn't able to guess the resource class name of a launcher correctly a "right click" menu option "Edit resource name" is added so that you manually edit the resource class name. 
- You can add launchers by pinning running applications via the "right click" menu (works for most applications, if the options are missing for an application you can still make a launcher by dragging the icon from gnome menu and manually edit the resource class name.)
- The launchers information are now stored in gconf instead for in the file  ~/.dockbarx/launchers.list. This will hopefully be a bit more stable.
- Some bugs in the launcher system are fixed. Some launchers that failed to be created or failed to launch it's application in previous versions should work now.

Other features:
- A new theme "Human Bar" by bigRZA is included. 
- Dockbarx should now use slightly less memory (not that much though).
- Keyboard shortcuts added for the "right click" menus.

Bug fixes:
- Dockbarx preference window crashed because of a stupid typo when using workspace mode 'ignore'.
- Dockbarx was freezing when the orientation of the applet changed.

x.0.23.2
End users features:
- Visual feedback on the numbers of open windows (if the theme supports it).
- A new group button action "select" replaces "select group", "select or minimize group" and "select or compiz scale group". You can configure how the new action should act when one window of a program is open and how it should act when multiple windows are open from the properties dialog.
- Option added: It is possible to not show popup window if there are just one window open . (Useful in combination with compiz windows preview.)
- Group button actions "compiz scale" and "compiz shift" will now just s
elect the window if there are only one unminimized window of a program.
- Groupbutton action 'select next' changed so that minimized windows are the last to be cycled through.
- Properties dialog is rearranged.
- "Default" and "New" themes updated to give feedback on multiple windows.

Theme making features:
- Possibility to add visual feedback on the numbers of windows.
- Offset argument added to <composite>
- New command: <colorize>
- Small bug fixes.
See Theming HOWTO for more information on the above changes.

Bug fixes:
- Dockbarx should work in intrepid and hardy again.
- Some icons didn't show up in dockbarx in some circumstances.
- Group button menu where not accessible in the last version if all windows where minimized.


x.0.23.1
IMPORTANT:
- Dockbarx now uses /usr/share/dockbarx and ~/.dockbarx for storing it's
 files instead of /usr/share/dockbar and ~/.dockbar (Bug #429043).

End users features:
- Compiz Thumbnails/preview are ported over from vanilla dockbar and is modified to work with delays.
- Opacify can now be used at group buttons. (Settings in preference dialog.)
- Group button actions 'compiz scale windows' and 'compiz switch windows' now includes the windows from all desktops. Same goes for 'select or compiz scale'.
- An option for no attention effect added. (Patch by Vermind)
- Group button action for opening preference dialog is added, since there were no way for AWN users to access it.

Bug fixes:
- One of the most long lived and most irritating bugs are now gone: Popup windows now closes even when the mouse is leaving it over one of the rounded corners.
- Some other cases where the popup window didn't close when it should are now fixed, as well.
- Untested bug fix for opacify for ubuntu 8.04 (hardy) and other systems with older versions of compiz fusion.
- Bug #424629: Dockbarx does no longer crash if an invalid theme 
is found in ~/.dockbarx/themes or /usr/share/dockbarx/themes. A dialog message is shown if no working themes are found.

... and some code cleanup.


x.0.21.11
End users features:
- Group button actions 'select next window' and 'select previous window' is added. Default buttons for them is scroll up and scroll down.
- Group button action 'select or compiz scale group' is added. It behaves like 'select or minimize group' action when only one window is open in a group. If there is more than one window in a group, 'compiz scale' is used instead.
- A two seconds launch prevention is now issued after each application launch. This will prevent multiple launches of applications as a result of people double clicking on launchers accidentally. (Blueprint and patch by Vermind. Thank you.)
- None square icons are no longer stretched out when shown on group buttons.
- 'New' and 'Minimalistic' themes been improved.

Theme making features:
- Theming HOWTO added.
- Group buttons can now be set to different aspect ratios.
- Alpha mask command added
- Get_pixmap command added
- The blink effect for attention is now dealt with in themes with the command <if type="blink"></if> instead of using the same effect as mouseover (<if command type="mouseover"></if>). This will make it possible for theme makers to make fancy mouseover or blink effects without having to worry about the side effects it might have on the other effect.
- Some small improvements and bug fixes

Bug fixes:
- Bug #402806: Popup windows got stuck if they where open when reload were pressed.
- Bug #411337: Closing a window that needed attention didn't stop the attention effect.
- Bug #406610: DockbarX behaved very oddly in Ubuntu Karmic.



Experimental 0.21.10
- Dockbarx now uses themes. They are .tar.gz files that should be put in /usr/share/dockbar/themes or ~/.dockbar/themes. Documentation on how to make themes will come later but you could always take a look on the existing theme files and try to change them, if you are curious. Be aware the much will still change when it comes to the format of the config file in the theme, though. New themes are added simply by moving them to either folder. 
- There are no more delays before closing the popup window when the mouse cursor is moved away from the group button (this should make those of you who uses no popup delay happy). On the other hand, when the mouse cursor is resting in the gap between group button and windowpane the window won't close (this should make slow moving people happy). This will hopefully lead to fewer situations where the popup window is left open as well.

Experimental 0.21.9
- A popup menu is added as a window button action (At right click in default settings).
- (Un)maximize all windows and (un)minimize all windows options are added to the group button popup menu.
- Brightness effect on launcher buttons are now only affecting the icon, not the whole button.
- New group button action Maximize all and new windows button action toggle maximized are added.
- Group button actions Select and Select or minimize no longer unlocks all locked windows in the group.
- Bug #374850 fixed: A small bug in the icon selection algorithm that caused dockbarx to crash in some situations. (Fix by Vermind, thx.)

Experimental 0.21.8
- Drag and drop of new launchers and moving of group buttons shows an indicator of where the group button will be placed.
- Onnmouseover brightness effect added. (This is just a temporary test and I will remove it unless I get positive feedback on it. Tell me your opinion!)
- Bug #371119 fixed: Pidgin contact list couldn't be activated, minimized or unminimized using select [or minimize] window button action.
- Bug #372235 possibly fixed: Opacify might work now with Compiz Fusion 0.7.4 (used in Ubuntu Hardy). (Compiz Fusion 0.7.4 users please tell me if this is true!)

Experimental 0.21.7
- When unlocking a window using lock/unlock action, the window is no longer unminimized.
- Move cursor is shown instead of copy cursor when moving a group button.
- Active window is set at startup.
- Bugfix: DockBarx didn't start if added to a vertical panel.
- Bug #370104 fixed: Preference dialog now works in hardy and other systems that uses pygtk <2.14.
- Bug #368721 fixed: Compiz scale all action doesn't leave popup window open anymore.
- Code clean up and documentation

Experimental 0.21.6
- It's now possible to raise windows via popup window during drag and drops. (Similar to what you can do with gnome's normal window list.)
- Delay added to opacify
- When using opacify, clicking a window button now brings transparency back to normal.
- Opacify is not initiated for minimized windows anymore.
- New window button action: Select window (no minimize).
- New group button action: Compiz scale all.

Experimental 0.21.5-1
- Really stupid bug fixed. Big "Sorry!" for not checking the code before releasing it.

Experimental 0.21.5
- Opacify: When the mouse cursor is over a window name in popup window all other windows get transparent. Activate it from preference dialog. (You need to activate "Opacity, Brightness and Saturation" plugin in compiz to use it.)
- AWN wrapper ported from vanilla DockBar (by Scott Barnes).

Experimental 0.21.4
- Bug fix: Popup windows didn't always resize correctly under Compiz if dockbarx were killed and restarted.
- The title of popup windows uses the normal text color instead of always being white.
- Small fixes to Compiz scale and compiz switch actions.
- Typo fixed.

Experimental 0.21.3
- Options in preference dialog for changing colors and transparency.
- Preference dialog is now split in two tabs (behavior and appearance).
- Bug fixes (unconfirmed).

Experimental 0.21.2
- New group button action: Compiz switch. Needs to be selected in preference dialog to be used (I recommend setting it on scroll up or down). Compiz switch plug in needs to be activated as well.
- When a group holds the active window and (a) minimized window(s) only the "normal" half will glow. (Once again: I'm really not sure if this looks any better. Opinions needed.)
- Some bug fixes. Tell me if any bug you reported has disappeared.

Experimental 0.21.1-1
- Bugfix: stupid bug stopping dockbarx from running in window.
- Slightly less transparency on active glow

Experimental 0.21.1
- The icons are now 2 pixels shorter on height and width. This will ensure a pixel on every side of the icon reserved for the active glow.
- The active glow is now changed to utilize it's extra space (meaning the glow is no longer overlapping the icon near the borders).
- The glow is now thicker and is fading towards it's ends.
- Some code clean up.

Experimental 0.21.0
- Version number changed to follow vanilla Dockbar (nothing ported over from vanilla Dockbar since 0.21 was a bugfix release for bugs - unless I'm mistaken - shouldn't exist in DockbarX)
- Minimized group icons are less transparent and has a slight notion of color in them
- The transition between the "minimized" and the "normal" half of the group button when some windows in a group are minimized is now smoother.
- The group button holding the active button "glows" now instead of using active_icon.png. (Tell me if the glow is a good idea or not. If it is I will add options for changing it's color and thickness from the preference dialog, otherwise I will remove it and go back to using active_icon.)

Experimental 0.20.8
- Resource class name is used instead of class name to keep groups together. Before this change DockBarX couldn't recognize that windows of some applications (like video window and control window for xine-ui) belonged together. Some applications (vlc amongst others) don't have a resource class name. These applications will still be using their class name.
- DockBarX tries to find the correct name for the application to show in the popup instead of just showing the class name. The algorithm is far from perfect. Please report any really odd names!
- If you need to know the resolution class name for adding a launcher, it's added as a tooltip to the title of the popup window.
- Another stupid bug fixed. (Hopefully this bug fix will stop jaunty from giving false crash reports for DockBarX.)

Experimental 0.20.7
- A completely redesigned popup look (with transparency if compositing is used)
- The light-up effect is removed from launcher rollover and the name of the application is shown instead. (Feedback needed: is this an improvement or not?)

Experimental 0.20.6
- Bug fix: Some programs (wine and possibly others) didn't show up in DockBar.
- Bug fix: Popup list blocks the popup menu. (This was actually already fixed in a silent update of 0.20.5, I apologize for not announcing it.)

Experimental 0.20.5
- New more intuitive look on minimized and locked window buttons

Experimental 0.20.4
- Adjustable popup delay (default 250 ms)
- As requested: Popup window alignment can be set in the preference dialog (Center alignment default)
- Dockbar now uses other gconf values than just strings (doesn't matter to you End-Users, unless you want to change settings with gconf-editor instead of preference dialog) 

Experimental 0.20.3
- Bug fix: DockBar won't crash if it can't find launcher_icon.png or active_icon.png
- Minor bug fixed: The popup list is closed when the viewport changes because of select group or select window actions. This way there are no risk that the popup is left open even if the mouse moved away from the group button during the switch animation.

Experimental 0.20.2
- The stupid bug fixed

Experimental 0.20
- The name is changed to DockBar Experimental or dockbarx for short to make it possible to have both vanilla DockBar
  and Dockbar Experimental installed at the same time. 
- Features ported back from vanilla DockBar 0.20 and 0.19:
   - Preference and about dialog, gconf configuration
   - Configurable "needs attention" effect
