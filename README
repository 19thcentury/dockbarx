DESCRIPTION
===========
This is a branch of DockBar (a TaskBar with grouping and group manipulation) with extra, "experimental" features added. 

This is not really a fork of DockBar! It's just another branch of the program. Some of the features in this version will hopefully find it's way into the vanilla DockBar some day, when they are proven stable and useful.


Dockbar is made by Aleksey Shaferov. 
DockbarX branch is developed by Matias Särs.
The button image used in "Default" and "New" themes are is made by Sami Rissanen (st6). 
Dockbar and DockbarX is licensed under GPL3.

About the experimental-ness and stability of dockbarx:
DockbarX is in some way an experimental version of dockbar. If you with stable mean "as bug free as possible", DockbarX will try to achieve that kind of stability. If you with stable mean that the program's default behavior will stay the same from a version to the next and that you won't have to relearn how to use parts of the program from an update to the next, then DockbarX isn't stable.


=======
INSTALL
=======
NOTE! IMPORTANT! From dockbarx x.0.23.1 dockbar uses folders /usr/share/dockbarx and ~/.dockbarx instead of /usr/share/dockbar and ~/.dockbar

1. install python-gnome2-desktop and python-numpy (DockbarX might be able to run without python-numpy, but it shouldn't hurt)
$ sudo apt-get install python-gnome2-desktop python-numpy
2. copy dockbarx.py to /usr/bin/ and GNOME_DockBarXApplet.server to /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
$ sudo cp dockbarx.py /usr/bin
$ sudo cp GNOME_DockBarXApplet.server /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
3. copy the content of themes folder to /usr/share/dockbarx/themes (for system wide installation, recommended) or ~/.dockbarx/themes (Create the folders if necessary)
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/dockbarx/themes
$ sudo cp  themes/* /usr/share/dockbarx/themes
4. add DockBarX applet to panel

You can run it in window (meant for debugging purposes, mostly):
$dockbarx.py run-in-window

INSTALL IN AWN

1. Do a normal install (no need to add dockbarx to panel if you don't want to, of course).
2. Copy everything from the AWN folder to ~/.config/awn/applets
3. Remove original taskbar/launcher applet from awn (optional, but recommended)
4. Set 'Icon offset' parameter to 0!
5. Restart AWN
6. Add DockBar applet


=====
USAGE
=====
The default actions are listed here. There are more actions in dockbarx. You can assign them to different buttons via preference dialog.

DEFAULT WINDOW BUTTON ACTIONS:
left click:
- activate / minimize / unminimize

middle click:
- close window

right click:
- minimize and lock


DEFAULT GROUP BUTTON ACTIONS:
left click:
- activate / minimize / unminimize group (launch application if no window is open)

shift + left click:
- launch application

middle double click:
- close group of windows

right click:
-open 'menu'

scroll up/down: 
- Select next/previous window of the group


LAUNCHERS:
Add launchers:
To add launchers simply drag the launcher you want from your gnome menu to the DockBar. (That means that you should drop it ON an existing button, not to the right or left of them. If you drop the launcher to the right of the buttons you will drop it on the panel and not on the DockBar applet). Write in the resource class name of the application whose launcher you added in the entry dialog and press OK (if the program is already running you can choose the resource class name from the drop down list). The launcher will appear after (on the right side) of the button you dropped the launcher of.

Remove launcher:
Right click on the launcher you wish to remove. Choose 'Remove launcher' from the menu. This will also close all open windows of that group button.

Move launchers (and other group buttons):
Drag and drop ;)


WORKSPACE/VIEWPORT BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:
You can change how DockBar reacts when you select a group (left click on the group icon if the default is used) from preference window.

Ignore: Acts as if windows on other workspaces and viewport doesn't exist.

Switch: Behaves as ignore if there are windows belonging to the group on the current workspace/viewport. If there are no windows belonging to the group on the current workspace/viewport it switches to the workspace/viewport with most windows that belong to the group. This is the default behavior.

Move: Moves windows from other workspaces/viewports to current workspace/viewport. This is the behavior vanilla Dockbar uses.

If you select a window in the popup list you will always switch to the workspace/viewport of the window. This is not configurable (vanilla Dockbar behaves the same way).

FAQ
===
Q: Help!?! I want to add an launcher but I don't know the resource class name of the program.
A1: The easiest way to add a launcher is to start the program first and then drag the launcher to to the DockBar. The resource class name can then be found in the drop down list.
A2: You can also find the resolution class name by: 1) launching the program your usual way, 2) when the icon appears in DockBar, hower over it and 3) when the popup window is shown, hower over the popup window title. The resource class name will be shown as a tooltip.

Q: How do I get to preference dialog?
A: Right click the handle (the dots or lines to the left of dockbarx) to get a menu where you can choose the preference option. Viola! Sometimes though, you have to double right click the handle to get the menu. Don't ask me why - just do it.

Q: None of DockbarX's compiz stuff like "compiz scall" work. Why?
A: Make sure you enable the GLib extension in Compiz settings manager and that the compiz plugin dockbarx uses is activated as well. (e.g. for group button action "compiz scale" to work you need the scale plugin activated)

Q: What is Opacify and how do I get it to work?
A: Opacify is a way to find localize a window with dockbar. When opacify is on and you roll over a name in the window list with the mouse, all other windows will become transparent so that you easy can spot the window. To activate opacify you need to go to the appearance tab of the preference dialog and check in opacify checkbox. Opacify requires compiz fusion  and you need to activate the plugin Opacity, Brightness and Saturation in CompizConfig!

Q: How do I install a theme?
A: If you find a theme on the web that you like, copy the file (should be SOMETHING.tar.gz) to ~/.dockbarx/themes or /usr/share/dockbarx/themes. You change themes in the appearance tab of preference dialog. You might need to press the reload button before your newly installed theme shows up.

Q: How can I make an theme of my own?
A: Read Theming HOWTO. If you need help ask me (Matias Särs alias M7S) on gnome-look or at launchpad.
